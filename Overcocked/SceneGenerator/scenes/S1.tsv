	Wonder if he cooked that Lasagna... NO. I need to forget that happened.	None		Orika - Happy	School corridor	
	"Yes! I've spoken to Cavallo-sensei already: Tomato sauce is one of the worst kinds of stains."	Orika		Orika - Happy	School corridor	
	"It sticks to your clothing like cheese to a hot pan."	Orika		Orika - Happy	School corridor

	"Oh shoot! I forgot. Well, I can eat four, no problem!"	Keisuke		Keisuke - Shirtless	Kitchen	
	His burgers are coming up quite pretty, I might as well eat one.	None		Keisuke - Shirtless	Kitchen	
	"Time to fire it up!"	Keisuke		Keisuke - Shirtless	Kitchen	
	He starts grilling the burgers. They smell fine. Not great, but I mean, it's very hard to fuck up a burger.	None		None	Kitchen	
	Unless you overcook it or...	None		None	Kitchen	
	"Blaaargh..."	Keisuke		None	Kitchen

	"Cof... cof... oh, nothing, everything is fine."	Keisuke		Keisuke - Shirtless	Kitchen	
	Did he... puked on the grill?	None		Keisuke - Shirtless	Kitchen	
	"Okay, ready for consumption! You sure you don't want one?"	Keisuke		Keisuke - Shirtless	Kitchen	
	"Yup." - I was considering eating one, until that 'blaargh'.	Hameru Tabe		Keisuke - Shirtless	Kitchen	
	"Your loss!"	Keisuke		Keisuke - Shirtless	Kitchen	
	He starts eating savagely.	None		Keisuke - Shirtless	Kitchen	
	The first burger is gone.	None		Keisuke - Shirtless	Kitchen	
	The second one as well.	None		Keisuke - Shirtless	Kitchen	
	The third one.. oh wat?	None		Keisuke - Shirtless	Kitchen	
	He starts running towards the door with a burger on his hand.	None		Keisuke - Shirtless	Kitchen	
	"Gosh... I'll be right back."	Keisuke		Keisuke - Shirtless	Kitchen	
	Maybe he went to puke? Hope he finds his way to the bathroom this time...	None		None	Kitchen	
	Anyway, let me take a look at his burguer.	None		None	Kitchen	
	Hm.	None		None	Kitchen	Mute

	Where is he?	None		None	Kitchen	
	I think I'm gonna look for him.	None		None	Kitchen	
	As I walk towards the bathroom, I find a track of vomit going to the exit door.	None		None	School corridor	Theme
	I follow it.	None		None	School corridor	
	I'm outside, and I can see him, with a new shirt on, sitting on the curb.	None		Keisuke - Wasted	School gates	
	"Hey Keisuke! What happened?"	Hameru Tabe		Keisuke - Wasted	School gates	
	"Hameru Tabe!!! I missed you. You are my friend, aren't you?"	Keisuke		Keisuke - Wasted	School gates	
	"Yes! I was waiting for you on the kitchen!" - I sit beside him.	Hameru Tabe		Keisuke - Wasted	School gates	
	"Oh... I forgot that..."	Keisuke		Keisuke - Wasted	School gates	
	"Usually I come outside... Because of the fresh air... And... And..."	Keisuke		Keisuke - Wasted	School gates	
	He rests his head on my shoulder. Hope he doesn't puke on me...	None		Keisuke - Wasted	School gates	
	"And... well... that's about it..."	Keisuke		Keisuke - Wasted	School gates	
	"Yeah, that's a good thing to do when you are sick..."	Hameru Tabe		Keisuke - Wasted	School gates	
	"Noooo maaaan! You are siiiick! I'm a dork!"	Keisuke		Keisuke - Wasted	School gates	
	"That's not the sick I meant..."	Hameru Tabe		Keisuke - Wasted	School gates	
	"Dork. Dork. Dork is a weird word, right?"	Keisuke		Keisuke - Wasted	School gates	
	"Oh damn... here we go... Drunk-talk..."	Hameru Tabe		Keisuke - Wasted	School gates	
	"Yes! Drunk talk! Fuck it. Fuck this school, fuck the food, fuck everything... Oooh! Speaking of fucking the food...."	Keisuke		Keisuke - Wasted	School gates	
	WHAT? DOES HE KNOW WHAT I DID? IT WAS ONE TIME ONLY! SHIT! I'LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN!	None		Keisuke - Wasted	School gates	
	"Did you know... that there's a food fucker on this school?"	Keisuke		Keisuke - Wasted	School gates	
	SHIT.	None		Keisuke - Wasted	School gates	
	"Yeeeeees... I heard he attacked five times last month.."	Keisuke		Keisuke - Wasted	School gates	
	"One time, I found the fucked food. It was a Taco. It was filled with cum. GUACUM MOLE. HAHAHAHAHA"	Keisuke		Keisuke - Wasted	School gates	
	Wait. I did not fuck a Taco. Is there another food fucker? Is that what I am now? A food fucker?	None		Keisuke - Wasted	School gates	
	"haha... GUACUM MOLE... That was terrible, wasn't it?"	Keisuke		Keisuke - Wasted	School gates	
	"Is there really a food fucker?"	Hameru Tabe		Keisuke - Wasted	School gates	
	"Oh yes... sorry for the bad joke.. but I really found that Taco. I almost ate it. Gross. I get sick just remembering it..."	Keisuke		Keisuke - Wasted	School gates	
	"... Blaaargh"	Keisuke		Keisuke - Puked	School gates	
	He puked again. Glad he moved his head on the opposite side from where I'm sitting.	None		Keisuke - Puked	School gates	
	But hey... Maybe I'm not so weird... Maybe food fucking is a common practice between chefs worldwide.	None		Keisuke - Puked	School gates	
	"Hey man... I think I'm going to sleep now, okay?"	Keisuke		Keisuke - Puked	School gates	
	"Let's go inside, I'll take you to your room... Oh wait... Where's your room?"	Hameru Tabe		Keisuke - Puked	School gates	
	"Just beside yours..."	Keisuke		Keisuke - Puked	School gates	
	That explains why he was trying to open my door...	None		Keisuke - Puked	School gates	
	I would try (and fail) to carry him, but he is managing to drag himself, I think I just need to steer him on the right directions.	None		Keisuke - Puked	School corridor	
	...	None		None	School corridor	
	That was tiring, but he is safe and sound inside his room. And I am on mine.	None		None	My room	
	Time to sleep, finally. It's almost morning already...	None	S1-21	None	My room

	But it will not hurt to try, I guess.	None		None	Kitchen	Fuck
	I start caressing my dick over my pants.	None	S1-20	None	Kitchen

	"Really? Nobody ever tries my dishes..."	Keisuke		Keisuke - Shirtless	Kitchen	
	"Why?"	Hameru Tabe		Keisuke - Shirtless	Kitchen	
	"Dunno. Maybe they think that because I take care of my body, I am a terrible cook."	Keisuke		Keisuke - Shirtless	Kitchen	
	"Well, you are not."	Hameru Tabe		Keisuke - Shirtless	Kitchen	
	"Thanks!"	Keisuke		Keisuke - Shirtless	Kitchen
