1	Yesterday was crazy. Wonder what will happen today. I don't think it will get as crazy as yesterday...	None		None	Black screen	Mute
	Besides the Italian cuisine class, I don't have any plans.	None		None	Black screen

	In fact, I don't even know if that is a thing... I better check the shared bathroom. Maybe the problem is only on my room...	None	S3-3	None	School corridor	
						
3	I walk towards the shared bathroom. The last time I've been here, I entered the ladies bathroom and found Rokuko.	None		None	School corridor	
	Weird that she never mentioned that.	None		None	School corridor	
	Her pie was delicious. If I find her again, I should ask for the recipe...	None		None	School corridor

	"Let me help you then."	Rokuko		Rokuko - Showing off	Bathroom

	I wait.	None		None	Bathroom	
	And he is not coming back.	None		None	Bathroom	Routine
	I carefully open the stall and see Keisuke brushing his teeth.	None		None	Bathroom	
	I close the stall. Keisuke hasn't seen me. I'd knew if he did.	None		None	Bathroom	
	I try to finish myself up, but it doesn't work.	None		None	Bathroom	
	Well, it works somehow, because my erection is gone.	None		None	Bathroom	
	I flush the toilet, just in case Keisuke is paying attention, and leave the stall.	None		None	Bathroom

	Oh shit! Orika is coming out of the door!	None		Orika - Neutral	School corridor	
	Everything is in slow motion, but I can't react.	None		Orika - Neutral	School corridor	
	I see her eyes turning at my direction.	None		Orika - Neutral	School corridor	
	I see the beginning of a smile.	None		Orika - Neutral	School corridor	
	I see her arm starting to rise and her hand starting to wave.	None		Orika - Neutral	School corridor	
	I see her smile becoming a scream.	None		Orika - Spooked	School corridor	
	I see she trying to protect herself with her arms.	None		Orika - Spooked	School corridor	
	I see her head turning slightly to the left, probably to avoid the impact with me...	None		Orika - Spooked	School corridor	
	I see all of this. And the time is coming.	None		Orika - Spooked	School corridor	
	Disaster.	None		None	School corridor

	"I..."	Hameru Tabe		Orika - Embarrassed;Cavallo - Neutral	School corridor	
	"Don't speak, catch your breath. Now, Orika-kun, it was nobody's fault. It was just an accident."	Cavallo		Orika - Embarrassed;Cavallo - Neutral	School corridor

	"Sure?"	Cavallo		Orika - Neutral;Cavallo - Neutral	School corridor	
	"Yeah. We can start the class now!"	Hameru Tabe		Orika - Neutral;Cavallo - Neutral	School corridor	
	"Okay. Orika-kun, can you keep an eye on Hameru Tabe?	Cavallo		Orika - Neutral;Cavallo - Neutral	School corridor

	"Today, we are going to learn one of the most classic Italian dish"	Cavallo		Cavallo - Neutral	Kitchen	
	Lasagna!	None		Cavallo - Neutral	Kitchen	
	"Pizza! Which flavor, you ask?"	Cavallo		Cavallo - Neutral	Kitchen	
	Awn...	None		Cavallo - Neutral	Kitchen	
	"Pepperoni!"	Cavallo		Cavallo - Neutral	Kitchen	
	"One of the simplest pizzas, yet, one of the most liked all around the globe."	Cavallo		Cavallo - Neutral	Kitchen	
	"You see, this is a Pepperoni."	Cavallo		Cavallo - Neutral	Kitchen	
	Wow. That's... a penis.	None		Cavallo - Neutral	Kitchen	
	Speaking of penis... Mine wants to participate.	None		Cavallo - Neutral	Kitchen	
	Here we go with the tensioned legs again.	None		Cavallo - Neutral	Kitchen	
	"But this will not go like this on the pizza."	Cavallo		Cavallo - Neutral	Kitchen	
	"We need to..."	Cavallo		Cavallo - Neutral	Kitchen	
	"SLICE IT!"	Cavallo		Cavallo - Neutral	Kitchen	
	(SLASH)	None		None	CG - Cutting Cock/Pepperoni	
	"Ouch."	Hameru Tabe		None	Kitchen	
	"HAHAHAHAHA"	Whole class		None	Kitchen	
	And my penis learned its lesson. I can relax my legs now.	None		None	Kitchen	
	At a first glance, Cavallo is a techer as good as Jacques,	None		None	Kitchen	
	but I think he uses his charisma so well that people think he is better than he really is.	None		None	Kitchen	
	Still, he is miles away from me. And he is pretty cool. Quite modern. Almost the opposite from Jacques.	None		None	Kitchen	
	50 minutes later...	None		None	Kitchen	
	"So, that's the story of how Italy lost the 94' world cup."	Cavallo		Cavallo - Neutral	Kitchen	
	"Oh, the pizza must be ready by now. Who wants to take it out of the oven?"	Cavallo		Cavallo - Neutral	Kitchen	
	"I think Hameru Tabe should do it! He felt the pain for that Pepperoni!"	Random student		Cavallo - Neutral	Kitchen	
	"Yeah!"	Another student		Cavallo - Neutral	Kitchen	
	I can already see what is going to happen.	None		None	Kitchen	
	I am going to open the oven.	None		None	Kitchen	
	The pizza will be handsome.	None		None	Kitchen	
	My dick will pop out of my pants and hit the pizza.	None		None	Kitchen	
	The pizza will be catapulted to Cavallo's face. And I'm gonna be expelled. Maybe arrested.	None		Cavallo - Neutral	Kitchen	
	"Oh, I'm still kinda dizzy from before..."	Hameru Tabe		Cavallo - Neutral	Kitchen	
	"I can go then!"	Orika		Orika - Happy	Kitchen	
	A commotion started.	None		Orika - Happy	Kitchen	
	I can hear some people saying that she will drop it, that she will burn her hair or something.	None		Orika - Neutral	Kitchen	
	"Calm down guys, calm down!"	Cavallo		Orika - Neutral;Cavallo - Neutral	Kitchen	
	The commotion stops for a bit.	None		Orika - Neutral;Cavallo - Neutral	Kitchen	
	"Let's take a break. Go do something you like, then come back here in 20 minutes."	Cavallo		Cavallo - Neutral	Kitchen	
	The commotion returns and some students start leaving the kitchen.	None		None	Kitchen	
	This 'break' thing seems to be common in this class.	None		None	Kitchen	
	What should I do with these 20 minutes?	None		None	Kitchen	Mute
	"Hey, Hameru Tabe, I know I asked to meet tonight, but maybe we can do it right now."	Orika		Orika - Neutral	Kitchen	Mute
	[OPT] Later is better for me, if that's okay.	None	S3-9	Orika - Neutral	Kitchen	
	[OPT] Okay. What is it?	None	S3-10	Orika - Neutral	Kitchen

	"I want to go over some notes"	Hameru Tabe		Orika - Neutral	Kitchen	
	"Oh... Tonight it is then."	Orika		Orika - Sad	Kitchen	
	While Orika goes back to her island, I think about Rokuko.	None		None	Kitchen	
	What was all that on the restroom about?	None		None	Kitchen	
	How could I confuse him with a girl?	None		None	Kitchen	
	I see him entering the class. He takes a look at me, and moves his lips.	None		Rokuko - Showing off	Kitchen	
	I think he is saying	None		Rokuko - Showing off	Kitchen	
	I...	None		Rokuko - Showing off	Kitchen	
	Know...	None		Rokuko - Showing off	Kitchen	
	About...	None		Rokuko - Showing off	Kitchen	
	The...	None		Rokuko - Showing off	Kitchen	
	Lasagna...	None		Rokuko - Showing off	Kitchen	
	WHAT?	None		None	Kitchen	Mute

10	"Let's go to somewhere quieter?"	Orika		Orika - Neutral	Kitchen	Routine
	"Sure. Where?"	Hameru Tabe		Orika - Neutral	Kitchen	
	"Ahm, I don't know. Your room, maybe?"	Orika		Orika - Neutral	Kitchen	
	"Okay."	Hameru Tabe		Orika - Neutral	Kitchen	
	I wonder what she wants with me.	None		None	Black screen	
	As we walk to my room, I notice that I've never walked with her.	None		None	School corridor	
	The way she walks... It seems she have a perfect sense of her body, which is not what I expected from a clumsy person.	None		None	School corridor	
	We don't say much on the way to my room, just random stuff about the weather.	None		None	School corridor	
	...	None		None	School corridor	
	"It's here."	Hameru Tabe		Orika - Neutral	School corridor

	"Can I go in?"	Orika		Orika - Neutral	School corridor	
	"Yeah, sure."	Hameru Tabe		Orika - Neutral	School corridor	
	We go in.	None		None	Black screen

	She sits on my bad and starts tapping on the mattress.	None		Orika - Neutral	My room	
	"You don't have much stuff in here..."	Orika		Orika - Embaressed	My room

	"Oh, no. Not at all. I don't have much breakable stuff anyway."	Hameru Tabe		Orika - Suspicious	My room	
	"Hm. Can I help you somehow?"	Orika		Orika - Neutral	My room

	"Ah! I am specialized in Exotic foods."	Orika		Orika - Happy	My room	
	"That's cool! What is your favorite?"	Hameru Tabe		Orika - Happy	My room

	"Wow. I'm really surprised. Can you show me how is done?"	Hameru Tabe		Orika - Happy	My room

12	"Actually... You told me you're clumsy and forgetful..."	Hameru Tabe	SET O F	Orika - Emarassed	My room	
	"But you walk as if you had full control of your body. You know? Your body seems to have self-awareness."	Hameru Tabe		Orika - Neutral	My room	
	"You noticed?"	Orika		Orika - Suspicious	My room	
	"And, you said you were forgetful, but you remembered where my room is."	Hameru Tabe		Orika - Suspicious	My room	
	"Hehe.. Oh-oh. Busted."	Orika		Orika - Emarassed	My room	Mute

	"Well... The answer to that will have to wait."	Orika		Orika - Showing off	My room	
	"Why?"	Hameru Tabe		Orika - Showing off	My room
